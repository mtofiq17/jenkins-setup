###  REAL WORLD SCENARIO  ###
Let's consider a real-world scenario where Jenkins is used in a typical software development workflow:

1. **Version Control**: Developers commit their code changes to a version control system like Git.

2. **Continuous Integration**: Jenkins is set up to monitor the version control system for changes. Whenever a new commit is made, Jenkins automatically triggers a build process.

3. **Build**: Jenkins checks out the latest code from the repository and performs a build process. This typically involves tasks such as compiling the code, running unit tests, and generating build artifacts.

4. **Automated Testing**: After the build is successful, Jenkins triggers automated tests. These tests can include unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and more, depending on the project's requirements.

5. **Code Quality Analysis**: Jenkins can integrate with code analysis tools like SonarQube or Checkstyle to perform static code analysis and generate reports on code quality, coding standards, and potential issues.

6. **Artifact Storage**: Jenkins archives the build artifacts, including compiled binaries, documentation, and other relevant files.

7. **Deployment**: Jenkins can deploy the built artifacts to various environments, such as staging or production servers. This can involve tasks like deploying to application servers, configuring databases, or setting up infrastructure.

8. **Notification and Reporting**: Jenkins sends notifications to relevant stakeholders, such as developers, testers, or project managers, about the build status, test results, and any issues encountered. It can also generate reports and metrics for monitoring and tracking the progress of the software development process.

9. **Continuous Deployment**: Jenkins can be configured to automate the deployment process to production environments based on predefined conditions and approvals. This ensures that code changes are seamlessly delivered to users without manual intervention.

10. **Monitoring and Scaling**: Jenkins can integrate with monitoring and alerting tools to track the performance and health of deployed applications. It can also scale the application infrastructure based on predefined rules or triggers.

11. **Scheduled Jobs**: Jenkins allows the scheduling of jobs for recurring tasks such as backups, database cleanups, or periodic maintenance tasks.

By leveraging Jenkins in this scenario, teams can achieve continuous integration, automated testing, code quality analysis, and streamlined deployment processes. Jenkins helps to automate repetitive tasks, ensure code stability, and improve collaboration among team members. Additionally, it provides visibility into the entire software development lifecycle, enabling efficient management and monitoring of the project.

## **Ways To Install Jenkins on Windows & Linux**

### **--- INSTALL JENKINS  ON LINUX METHOD -1 ---**

```shell
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre -y

curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update -y 
sudo apt-get install jenkins -y

sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

### **--- INSTALL JENKINS ON LINUX METHOD -2 ---**

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre
wget https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.452.1/jenkins.war
java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8082
```
### **--- INSTALL JENKINS ON WINDOWS ---**

Follow these step-by-step instructions to install Jenkins on your Windows machine:

1. Visit the official Jenkins website at [https://www.jenkins.io/](https://www.jenkins.io/) and go to the "Download" section.

2. Click on the "Windows" tab and download the latest stable release of Jenkins for Windows as a "Generic Java package (.war)" file.

3. Once the download is finished, navigate to the location where you saved the Jenkins ".war" file.

4. Open a command prompt by pressing "Win + R" and typing "cmd", then hit Enter.

5. In the command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the Jenkins ".war" file using the `cd` command. For example, if you saved the file in the "Downloads" folder, you would use the command: `cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads`.

6. Once you're in the correct directory, run the following command to start Jenkins: `java -jar jenkins.war`.

7. Jenkins will start initializing, and you'll see some log output in the command prompt.

8. Open a web browser and go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). This is the default URL for accessing the Jenkins web interface.

9. On the Jenkins web page, you'll be prompted to enter the initial administrator password. To obtain the password, go back to the command prompt where Jenkins is running and look for the line that says "Please unlock Jenkins". Copy the alphanumeric password from there.

10. Paste the administrator password into the Jenkins web interface and click "Continue".

11. On the next screen, choose the option "Install suggested plugins" to install the recommended set of plugins. This will enable basic functionality in Jenkins.

12. Wait for the plugin installation to complete. Once done, you'll be prompted to create an admin user. Fill in the required details and click "Save and Continue".

13. Finally, you'll see the Jenkins dashboard, where you can start setting up your projects and automation workflows.

That's it! You have successfully installed Jenkins on your Windows machine. Feel free to explore the various features and capabilities offered by Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery.
